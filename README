This class is a port of Laravel's blade templating system for CodeIgniter framework. 

It's compatible with Modular Extensions - HMVC and it uses the file cache for store compiled templates.

To install simply put the file into application/libraries and make sure that application/cache folder is writable.

By default template views must have .blade.php as extension. You can change this in $blade_ext class property.

Example usage in a controller:

	class Test extends MX_Controller
	{

		public function __construct()
		{
			parent::__construct();
			$this->load->library('blade');
		}	
	
		public function index()
		{
			$this->blade->set('foo', 'bar')
				->set_data('an_array', array(1, 2, 3, 4))
				->append('an_array', 5)
				->render('test', array('message' => 'Hello World!'));
		}
	
	}
